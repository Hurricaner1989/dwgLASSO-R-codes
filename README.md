# dwgLASSO R package

This package implements dwgLASSO algorithm from Zuo *et*. *al*.'s BMC Bioinformatics paper: **Incorporating prior biological knowledge for network-based differential gene expression analysis using differentially weighted graphical LASSO** (PMID: 28187708). It contains one demo (i.e., **demo.R** and files in Data folder) and one **function.R**. 

## Update

### 02/15/17

I submit version 1.0 which contains one demo (i.e., **demo.R** and files in Data folder) and one **function.R**. 

* **demo.R** implements the proposed dwgLASSO algorithm in BMC Bioinformatics paper in a setting for survival time prediction.
* **function.R** implements three helper functions that are used in **demo.R**.
